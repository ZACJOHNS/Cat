MILESTONE 4
A simple command line interface (CLI).

This program runs a loop within which it accepts user input from stdin, and uses the system() function to run arbitrary system commands (other than the exit command).
A user inputs a string which is stored within a character string with a predetermined size. The fgets() function accepts a buffer length with is set to 80.
If the user string is not NULL and is not equal to "exit", it is passed to the system() function for appropriate handling.
If the user has entered the "exit" command, the program will return EXIT_SUCCESS.
