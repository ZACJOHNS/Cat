MILESTONE 4
A simple command line interface (CLI).

This program runs a loop within which it accepts user input from stdin, and uses the system() function to run arbitrary system commands (other than the exit command).
A user inputs a string which is stored within a character string with a predetermined size. The fgets() function accepts a buffer length with is set to 80.
If the user string is not NULL and is not equal to "exit", it is passed to the system() function for appropriate handling.
If the user has entered the "exit" command, the program will return EXIT_SUCCESS.

THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SYSTEM() AND EXECVP()
- System() will execute a command specified by a commmand argument and return after the command has been completed.

- The execvp() function will replace the current process image with a new process image. The argument list that execvp() accepts must be an array of pointers to null terminated strings.

WHY CALLING THE EXISTING CD SHELL COMMAND WON'T WORK
- The newly created children through execvp() inherit the working directory from the parent, changing the working directory of the parent after the fork process will not affect any previously created children. Similarily, changing the working directory in a child process won't have any effect on the parent process.
